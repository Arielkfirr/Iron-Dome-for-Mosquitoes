# Iron Dome for Mosquitoes - Project Summary

**Iron Dome for Mosquitoes** is a production-ready, modular system for real-time mosquito detection and prevention using AI, computer vision, and IoT.

## Project Journey & Key Milestones

- **Idea & Planning:**
  - Started as a creative robotics/AI project: detect mosquitoes using computer vision and shoot them with a servo-based mechanism.
  - Broke down the idea into: detection, spatial localization, robotic actuation, and integration.

- **Hardware Selection:**
  - Chose Raspberry Pi 5 (with camera), Arduino Uno, SG90 servos, robot arm kit, and all necessary wiring.
  - Ordered parts efficiently (tips for splitting Amazon orders to avoid taxes).

- **Dataset & Model:**
  - Built/collected a dataset of mosquito/fly images, including backgrounds for robust detection.
  - Used YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for object detection, with augmentation and labeling tools (LabelImg, Roboflow).
  - Achieved reliable detection (<3s per image) with confidence thresholding.

- **Software & Integration:**
  - Python code for real-time detection (OpenCV + YOLOv8).
  - Arduino code for servo control (receives 'fire' command via serial).
  - Full integration: detection triggers servo firing if confidence > 0.6.
  - Modular architecture: detection, camera, prevention, monitoring, database, web interface.

- **Testing & Iteration:**
  - 9/9 test phases passed (unit, integration, end-to-end).
  - Debugging and troubleshooting (Cursor IDE, PowerShell, permissions, serial issues).
  - One-click setup scripts and quick start guides for easy onboarding.

- **Learning & Achievements:**
  - Gained hands-on experience in:
    - Object detection and dataset creation
    - Real-time computer vision
    - Hardware-software integration (Python â†” Arduino)
    - Project management and documentation
    - Efficient online purchasing and logistics
  - Built a fully working prototype, ready for further expansion (web dashboard, analytics, advanced robotics).

- **Practical Tips:**
  - Use Python 3.10.x for best compatibility.
  - Split expensive hardware orders to avoid import taxes.
  - Start with simulation (images/videos) before full hardware integration.
  - Use Cursor IDE for rapid development and debugging.
  - Document every step for easy continuation and onboarding.
